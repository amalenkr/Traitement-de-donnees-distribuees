# Distributed computing
#### By Lilia BEN BACCAR and Amale NOKRI
A comparison between sequential execution, multithreading, multiprocessing (`Pool`) and multiprocessing (`Process`) with multiple experiments.

### Files
Here are the description of each file. Each file corresponds to an application for which we will test sequential execution, multithreading and multiprocessing (with `Pool` and `Process`)
| Files | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `sleep.py` | Delaying the execution for a given number of seconds |
| `calculation.py` | Product of all the elements in a list of large numbers |
| `classification.py` | Binary classification problem hyperparameters tuning with a GridSearchCV |
| `face_detection.py` | Face detection experiment on 187 photos |
| `nlp.py` | Textual data pre-processing + Word2Vec on 3 datasets |
| `Data` | Data folder |
| `report.pdf` | Project (french) report |
